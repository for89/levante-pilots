First downward extension analysis. There's lots more to do here. 

* We don't have any SDS data because we don't have it scored under the IRT model yet. 
* We're missing a bit of memory data because the scoring excludes kids that don't get *any* trials right. 

```{r}
thetas <- read_rds(here("02_scoring_outputs/scores/independent_scores.rds")) 
runs <- read_rds(here("01_fetched_data/run_data.rds")) 

us <- thetas |>
  left_join(select(runs, -site)) |>
  filter(item_task %in% c("hf","matrix","mg","mrot","sds")) |>
  mutate(is_de = site == "us_pilot")
```

```{r}
ggplot(us, aes(x = age, y = metric_value)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = is_de), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(us, is_de), method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~item_task) +
  xlab("Age (years)") +
  ylab("Ability") + 
  labs(title = "US pilot data", 
       subtitle = "Scored using full-pooling IRT model")
```
